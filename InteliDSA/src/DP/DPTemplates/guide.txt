⭐ MOST USEFUL: The Mental Flow

Whenever you see a DP problem, ask:

Step 1 — Is it take/skip? → subsequence template
Step 2 — Order doesn't matter? → subset/knapsack DP
Step 3 — Do states depend on remainder/value? → prefix/gcd/xor DP
Step 4 — Are we comparing two strings? → LCS/edit DP
Step 5 — Subarray with partitions? → interval DP
Step 6 — Subset enumerations? → bitmask DP
Step 7 — Counting numbers between ranges? → digit DP
