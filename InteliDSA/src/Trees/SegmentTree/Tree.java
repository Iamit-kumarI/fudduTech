/*
*  why segment tree:            like suppose we are given an array and ask to find sum of all
*                                num in array or in a range so it will take O(N) right sum+=arr[i]
*                               which is O(N) 21 sep 2025
*                               sum+=arr[i] if o(N) not so good
* use cases:                    when we are asked to do something in a range sike sum of array or
*                               max of min or product of all no many like this we can do by segment
*                               tree in o(LogN) isntead of O(N)
